# AoW-Zeta
For AoW enthusiasts


## How to build (windows only at this time)

Run `compile-acs.bat` then `zeta-to-pk3.bat`.
A file called `aow2_zeta.pk3` will be created. This is the main file.


** AoW Zeta can ONLY be run on Zandronum 3.0! 2.1.2 or older will bring an error.
(skulltag content is NOT required.)
