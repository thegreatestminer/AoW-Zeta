- Balance / Tweak
~ Bugfix
* Note

Note: Zeta is not based on AOW 2.1, however, for ease of understanding, this changelog is relative to the last version of 2.1 largely played.

------------------------------------------------------------
----- GAMEPLAY
------------------------------------------------------------
- 	Armor resistance now increases 1% per grade instead of 2% (grade 1 has 8% protection, grade 2 has 9%, etc.);
- 	Enhanced Refining extra income reduced to $125, from $150;
- 	Enhanced Timed C4s are now a global team research, instead of being given per-class or per-rank. Standard Timed C4s have 520 health (from 500),
	and the research increases their health to 650 (instead of 700). Enhanced C4s no longer do more damage than regular ones;
- 	Extra Frag Grenades and Flashbangs now cost $150 each, from $200;
- 	All maps now have research centre panels in the spawn room as well as in the building itself.
-	Anti-troll mechanics are in-place now. Any Orcas, C4's, Nukes/Ions thrown near friendly terminals will disappear.

----- CRATE CHANGES ------
+ 	Added Grenade Pack crate, which gives you 4 Frag Grenades and 4 Flashbangs;
- 	Base Crasher and Base Miracle can no longer occur during Sudden Death, nor 5 minutes before it;
- 	Base Crasher can no longer occur if any of the team's buildings are below 50% health (OBE/RES/BAR) or 40% health (REF/WF);
- 	Base Miracle can no longer occur if all of the team's buildings are already at or above 99% health;
- 	Random Weapon can no longer give you Plasma Cannon;
- 	C4 crate now properly sets your maximum C4 amount to 4, so you can safely refill that amount, and can no longer occur if you already have 4;

------------------------------------------------------------
----- CLASSES
------------------------------------------------------------
++	Classes no longer have armor "weaknesses" (Do note that this was the behavior in 2.1 as well)
	* They do still have resistance to certain weapon types. For example, flamer is no longer weak against chem
	but is still resistant against fire-based weapons.
+	New class, Advanced Sniper
	* Weapon: Advanced sniper rifle. Pinpoint accurate unscoped and will two-shot most infantry.
	* 55% movement speed
	* -1 Grade armor
	* Costs $1000
	* Drops weakened sniper rifle on death.
+ 	Karasawa Soldier imported.
+	Chem sprayer has his own skin now.
- 	Chrono Archer: speed reduced to 85%, from 90%;
- 	Shotgunner: speed increased to 90%, from 80%, and grade 1 armor removed;
- 	Technician: price increased to $300, from $200;
- 	Demolitions Expert: speed reduced to 70%, from 75%;
- 	MachineGunner, MiniGunner and Jet Trooper have Bullet Resistance again. 
	(Bullet Resistance is 25% less effective than Energy & Explosion resistances)
	
------------------------------------------------------------
----- WEAPONS
------------------------------------------------------------
+ 	All weapon skins now have crouch sprites (except for medic);
+ 	Chainsaw rework. 
	* It is back to its Doom self, and no longer insta-kills everything. 
	* Still shreds people down VERY quickly (firing rate reduced);
+	Flashbangs imported.
- 	SMG: main and altfire have been swapped. Both are also SLIGHTLY less accurate;
- 	Gatling Gun: shoots twice as many bullets (but damage per bullet is halved), vertical spread lowered: it is slightly less effective beyond close range;
- 	Chrono Bow: charges nearly twice as fast, bolt speed and damage scales SLIGHTLY less with charging, and maximum damage is slightly lower. Blast 
	radius was also reduced considerably. However, Chrono Bow damage completely ignores armor, and can consistently 2-shot even maximum rank infantry;
- 	Grenade Launcher: Grenades have slightly less gravity, thus increased range;
- 	Plasma Gun: Cools down slightly faster, and does 17 damage per shot instead of 15;
- 	Bomb-Squad Gun: Disarms explosives about 30% faster;
- 	Tiberium and Combustion autorifles: Have more devastating altfires on their strong version;
-	Remover Gun: Deconstruction speed greatly increased,
~ 	Suicide Bomb Pack should consistently play sound now instead of randomly stopping.
~ 	Missile Launcher's homing no longer stops working randomly. Blast away!
~	Hand Grenades have kill messages now.

------------------------------------------------------------
----- MECHS
------------------------------------------------------------
+ 	New heavy mech, Rhino.
	* Comes with a Shock Cannon, Plasma Cannon, and LRM-10.
	* Can't give out any other detail, we're not sure on pricing, speed, etc.
+ 	Wolverine is now fully team-colored;
+ 	Titan and Wolverine now have firing sprites for their explosive attacks;
- 	Orca: price increased to $1250, from $1000;
- 	Wolverine: Price increased from $1250 to $1500.
- 	Tortoise: focused on anti-infantry, keeps its energy and bullet attacks but no longer has grenades. Priced at $1500.
~	Mechs can no longer switch teams, get out of them first.

------------------------------------------------------------

++ Updated various maps to the last change Dusk's team did.

----- MISC / BUG FIXES
------------------------------------------------------------
*** All ACS has its source available in the file. Anyone can recompile the scripts themselves to verify the lack of "hidden" code, which was plentiful in AOW 2.1; ***
