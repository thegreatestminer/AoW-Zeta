Note: Zeta is not based on AOW 2.1, however, for ease of understanding, this changelog is relative to the last version of 2.1 largely played.


--------------------------------------------
----- GAMEPLAY -----------------------------
--------------------------------------------


- Armor resistance now increases 1% per grade instead of 2% (grade 1 has 8% protection, grade 2 has 9%, etc.);

- Enhanced Refining extra income reduced to $125, from $150;

- Enhanced Timed C4s are now a global team research, instead of being given per-class or per-rank. Standard Timed C4s have 520 health (from 500),
and the research increases their health to 650 (instead of 700). Enhanced C4s no longer do more damage than regular ones;

- Extra Frag Grenades and Flashbangs now cost $150 each, from $200;

- All maps now have research centre panels in the spawn room as well as in the building itself

----- CRATES -----

- Base Crasher and Base Miracle can no longer occur during Sudden Death, nor 5 minutes before it;

- Base Crasher can no longer occur if any of the team's buildings are below 50% health (OBE/RES/BAR) or 40% health (REF/WF);

- Base Miracle can no longer occur if all of the team's buildings are already at or above 99% health;

- Random Weapon can no longer give you Plasma Cannon;

- C4 crate now properly sets your maximum C4 amount to 4, so you can safely refill that amount, and can no longer occur if you already have 4;

+ Added Grenade Pack crate, which gives you 4 Frag Grenades and 4 Flashbangs;




--------------------------------------------
----- CLASSES ------------------------------
--------------------------------------------


- Chrono Archer: speed reduced to 85%, from 90%;

- Shotgunner: speed increased to 90%, from 80%, and grade 1 armor removed;

- Technician: price increased to $300, from $200;

- Demolitions Expert: speed reduced to 70%, from 75%;

+ MachineGunner, MiniGunner and Jet Trooper have Bullet Resistance again.
(Bullet Resistance is 25% less effective than Energy & Explosion resistances)



--------------------------------------------
----- WEAPONS ------------------------------
--------------------------------------------


+ All weapon skins now have crouch sprites (except for medic);

+ Chainsaw is back to its Doom self, and no longer insta-kills everything, but still shreds people down VERY quickly (firing rate reduced);

- SMG: main and altfire have been swapped. Both are also SLIGHTLY less accurate;

- Gatling Gun shoots twice as many bullets (but damage per bullet is halved), vertical spread lowered: it is slightly less effective beyond close range;

- Chrono Bow charges nearly twice as fast, bolt speed and damage scales SLIGHTLY less with charging, and maximum damage is slightly lower.
Blast radius was also reduced considerably. However, Chrono Bow damage completely ignores armor, and can consistently 2-shot even maximum rank infantry;

- Grenade Launcher's grenades have slightly less gravity, thus increased range;

- Plasma Gun cools down slightly faster, and does 17 damage per shot instead of 15;

- Bomb-Squad Gun disarms explosives about 30% faster;

- Tiberium and Combustion autorifles have more devastating altfires on their strong version;

~ Bomb Pack no longer

~ Missile Launcher's homing no longer stops working randomly. Blast away!



--------------------------------------------
----- MECHS --------------------------------
--------------------------------------------


- Orca: price increased to $1250, from $1000;

- Tortoise: focused on anti-infantry, keeps its energy and bullet attacks but no longer has grenades.

+ Wolverine is now fully team-colored;

+ Titan and Wolverine now have firing sprites for their explosive attacks;

+ New heavy mech, Rhino.
	* Comes with a Shock Cannon, Plasma Cannon, and LRM-10.

----- MISC & BUGFIXES ----------------------
--------------------------------------------


*** All ACS has its source available in the file. Anyone can recompile the scripts themselves to verify the lack of "hidden" code, which was plentiful in AOW 2.1; ***

++ All CVars had the aow_ prefix changed to zeta_ to prevent conflict with the existing CVars;
	
~ Sandbags should no longer be glitchy when placed near ledges;

~ All Mechs look big and imposing again, instead of being shrunk down;

~ Ravens no longer spawn when you eject out of a mech;

~ Mech explosions can no longer damage your own buildings;

~ Timed C4 flames no longer hurt your own base or teammates;

~ You can no longer use C4s while piloting a mech;

~ You can no longer equip Armor just before picking a class or entering a mech - if you do so, it will be lost;

~ Instant Juggernaut no longer keeps your armor;

~ Many, many more ACS fixes.
